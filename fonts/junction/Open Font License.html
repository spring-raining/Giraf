<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
